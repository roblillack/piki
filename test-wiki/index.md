# Test Wiki

Welcome to the test wiki!

## Plugin Demo

Click here to see the dynamically generated index: [[!index]]

This link uses the plugin system - pages starting with `!` are handled by plugins instead of loading files.

## Regular Links

- [[existing]] - A regular page that exists
- [[project-a/standup]] - A nested page (will be created on first save)

## How Plugins Work

Plugins are triggered by page names starting with `!`. For example:
- `[[!index]]` - Shows all pages in the wiki
- More plugins can be added in the future!
