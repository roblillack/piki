# Test Document

This test document showcases some functionality of our rendering engine. Mainly, we want to ensure that the words are wrapped correctly and that various Markdown features are rendered properly.

So, without further ado, here are some examples:

## Inline Styles

- To show our support for classic inline styles, **bold** and *italic* text are rendered as expected

- Of course, we do also support the more modern `inline code` styling with a monospace font

- Another thing, you can see quite often is support for ~~strikethrough~~ text to highlight deletions

- Apart from that, we also support <u>underlined</u> text, even though it's not part of standard Markdown

- My personal favorite, though, is <mark>highlighted</mark> using the `<mark>` HTML tag

- Lastly, we have [links](./example.md) shown in classic blue with underline

## Paragraph Styles

### The basics

1. Paragraphs are separated by a blank line

2. First line of each paragraph is indented

3. Blockquotes are rendered with a gray background

4. Code blocks are rendered with a monospace font

### Headers

# Header, level 1

## Header, level 2
