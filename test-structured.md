# Test Structured Editor

This is a **test** of the structured editor. It should handle markdown as a *storage format* only.

**New Features:** Press Cmd-Shift-H (or Ctrl-Shift-H on Linux/Windows) to cycle through heading levels (plain → H1 → H2 → H3 → plain). Press Cmd-Shift-8 (or Ctrl-Shift-8) to toggle list formatting.

## Features

- Proper cursor handling
- No markdown symbols visible
- Clean editing experience
- [Click this link to test](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Try typing in a **heading** and the `#` symbol should not appear!

## Code Example

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

> This is a blockquote to test rendering.

The structured document model completely separates the UI from markdown syntax.
