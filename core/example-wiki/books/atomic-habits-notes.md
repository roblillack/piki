# Notes: *Atomic Habits*

**Author**: James Clear  
**Theme**: Systems-focused personal improvement

## Core Ideas

- **1% Better** – Compounding gains beat sporadic intensity
- **Identity-Based Habits** – Change self-perception first, actions follow
- **Habit Loop** – Cue → Craving → Response → Reward; tweak the loop to change behavior
- **Make it Obvious / Attractive / Easy / Satisfying** – Four laws for building habits

## Highlights

- Habit stacking works well before morning runs (e.g., coffee → mobility drills → run)
- Environment design: keep foam roller in living room to prompt evening recovery
- Reframe setbacks as experiments; track learnings in `personal/marathon-training`

## Actions to Try

- Implement 2-minute rule for nightly stretching
- Weekly habit review on Sundays during meal prep
- Pair new learning habit with existing `tech/rust-learning-path` study block
