## Scratch Space

**URGENT**: Remember to submit reimbursement for conference travel by EOW

**Client meeting notes (10/27)**:

- They want the API rate limits increased to 10k/hour
- Need cost analysis by next Tuesday
- Mentioned potential expansion to EU region

**Training thought**: Consider switching long run to Saturdays instead of
Sundays - might be easier to recover before Monday meetings

**Family reminder**: Mom's birthday next month - coordinate with Sarah about
gift

## Focus Areas

### Work

- **Sprint Goal**: Complete authentication refactor and migration path
- **On my plate**:
  [work/performance-optimization](work/performance-optimization),
  [work/api-documentation-update](work/api-documentation-update)
- **Blocked on**: DevOps team needs to provision staging environment

### Personal Development

- Reading: [books/atomic-habits-notes](books/atomic-habits-notes) - applying to
  training routine
- Learning: [tech/rust-learning-path](tech/rust-learning-path) - side project
  ideas

### Health & Fitness

- **Marathon**: Week 6 of 18, base building phase
- **Current weekly volume**: 35 miles
- **Next milestone**: 16-mile long run on Saturday

## This Week's Schedule Conflicts

- Tuesday: Client call 2-3pm + Emma's parent-teacher conference 3:30pm (tight!)
- Thursday: Long meeting day - pack lunch, no time for gym
- Saturday: Long run starts 6am, family brunch at 10am

## Quick Captures

*Use this space for fleeting thoughts to process later*

- Idea: What if we cached the API responses at the edge? Could reduce database
  load significantly
- Need to research: Best half-marathon races in spring as tune-up for full
- Follow-up: Check with Mark about the Jenkins pipeline failures
- Random: Emma asked about getting a dog again - maybe revisit after vacation?
