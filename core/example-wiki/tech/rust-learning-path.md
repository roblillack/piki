# Rust Learning Path

**Objective**: Build confidence to ship production-grade Rust services by Q1.

## Milestones

- [x] Complete *Rustlings* exercises
- [x] Build CLI prototype (Piki sidecar tool)
- [ ] Finish *Zero To Production In Rust* book (up to chapter 10)
- [ ] Contribute PR to open-source crate (target: async HTTP client)

## Study Plan
