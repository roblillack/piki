# Injury Prevention Toolkit

**Objective**: Stay healthy through marathon block and strength cycles.

## Warm-Up Routine

1. Leg swings (front/back + lateral) – 10 each side
2. World’s greatest stretch – 2 rounds
3. High knees + butt kicks – 30 seconds each
4. Strides (4x with full recovery)

## Strength Focus

- **Glute activation**: Mini-band walks, single-leg bridges
- **Core stability**: Planks (front/side), dead bugs
- **Ankles/Achilles**: Eccentric heel drops, towel scrunches

## Recovery Staples

- Foam roll calves, quads, and IT band post-run
- Trigger point ball for plantar fascia and glutes
- Contrast showers after long runs
- Sleep tracker + HRV to catch fatigue early

## When Something Feels Off

- 48-hour rule: If pain persists more than two days, schedule PT session
- Log discomfort in `sports/training-log` to monitor patterns
- Reduce intensity before cutting volume entirely
